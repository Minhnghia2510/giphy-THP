# GiphyTHP

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.1.2.

## Development process:
Time spend on: 1 days
The coding and api wasn't that of a challenge but making it look good on it own it quite a process to be done.
What i would have add is a save button to save gifs on to a fav tab or something similar, maybe even a way login and save gifs on giphy using the giphy api. I also took the time to add a "Take a look" button in order for user to get access to the original giphy page of the gif
